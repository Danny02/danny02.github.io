Most software tests are example driven. Another approach is property based testing which checks the invariants
of the code by using generated test data.

Property based testing is widely used in the functional programming community, but mostly unknown in the world of
imperative programming. In this presentation I want to introduce you to property based testing. So that you are able
to use it in your project, know which are the benefits, and are able to overcome it pitfalls.
